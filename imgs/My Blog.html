                        <h1>Learing web programming</h1>
                        <p>Just starting to learn web programming, got the basics of HTML and now staring to look on more advanced programming skills.
                        This is some of the tools i've been looking at:</p>
                                <ul>
                                        <li> Apache2 - The greatest webserver, dead simple to use</li>
                                        <li> PHP - Simple scripting language, lets you create advanced websites</li>
                                        <li> Bazaar - The worlds best version control!</li>
                                        <li> MariaDB - Simple database server, very useful in PHP</li>
                                </ul>
                        <hr><script>console.log(scandir())</script>
                        <h1>Learning PHP</h1>
                        <p>I recently started to learn PHP and I'm currently updating all my old HTML projects to PHP. In fact this blog is powered with PHP.
                        At least i've changed the file extension. 
                        Unfortunaly i have the PHP code commented out for now since it doesn't work properly yet. 
                        I'll have to look on that later.</p>
